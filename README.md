# RFFGen
A fast and easy to use function generation library that gives provides access to the first three derivatives of a function.

Function arguments can be matrices and/or scalars. Vectors are also possible but not most functionality targets on matrices.

# Installation
Most of the library is template-based and thus header-only. 
Only some of the files in RFFGen/CMath need to be compiled.
